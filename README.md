Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates by preference instead of selecting just one. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the next preferences. This process repeats until a candidate secures a majority. Unlike plurality voting, which may declare a winner without majority support, ranked-choice voting better reflects voter preferences. The program `runoff.c` simulates this instant-runoff system, demonstrating how voter preferences can influence election outcomes beyond simple vote counts.
